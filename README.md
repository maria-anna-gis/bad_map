# A Bad map ðŸ˜ˆ

This map has been created to fulfil part of the requirements of Assignment 2 of the course "Application Development (GIS): Part 1, R for reproducible spatial analysis".

## Data source
The area outlines for Germany were downloaded from [GADM](https://gadm.org/) at a level 4 resolution, and then the data was grouped as to whether "B/bad" is included within the name.
